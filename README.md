## Example Queries  

### Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows
```sql
SELECT
    type,
    rating
FROM
    (
        SELECT 
            type, 
            rating, 
            COUNT(*) AS rating_count,
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS common_rating
        FROM netflix
        GROUP BY type, rating
    ) AS table1
WHERE table1.common_rating = 1
```

### Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords 
```sql
WITH new_table AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        CASE
            WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'bad content'
            ELSE 'good content'
        END AS category
    FROM netflix
)
select category, count(*) from new_table group by category
```

### Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix. 

```sql
SELECT 
    release_year,
    COUNT(*) AS yearly_content,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / 
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix WHERE country ILIKE '%India%')::NUMERIC * 100, 
        2
    ) AS average_content_percentage
FROM netflix
WHERE country ILIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY release_year
